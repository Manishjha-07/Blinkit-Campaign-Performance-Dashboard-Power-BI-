### 1️⃣ Strong Campaign Reach
With 29M impressions and 3M clicks, the campaigns show strong visibility and engagement.  
The click volume indicates effective audience targeting.

### 2️⃣ Healthy Conversion Performance
298K conversions reflect solid campaign effectiveness.  
The conversion rate suggests that users are not just clicking but also completing desired actions.

### 3️⃣ Positive Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
A ROAS of 2.74 means that for every 1 unit spent, 2.74 units are generated in revenue.  
This indicates profitable campaign performance.

### 4️⃣ Revenue vs Spend Analysis
Revenue generated is consistently higher than the spend across campaigns, showing strong marketing efficiency.

### 5️⃣ Channel Contribution
- App, Social Media, SMS, and Email contribute almost equally to total spend distribution (~24–26% each).  
This balanced channel allocation reduces risk and improves overall campaign stability.

### 6️⃣ Top Performing Campaign Types
Campaigns like Category Promotion, Flash Sale, and Referral Program show strong revenue generation compared to spend.  
These can be prioritized for future marketing strategies.
